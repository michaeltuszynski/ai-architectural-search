# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AI-powered search system that enables users to find architectural building photographs using natural language queries about visual features. The system serves as a proof-of-concept demonstrating how AI can understand and match visual architectural elements with user search intent.

## Glossary

- **AI_Search_System**: The complete application that processes natural language queries and returns relevant architectural images
- **Vision_Model**: The AI model that analyzes images and generates textual descriptions of architectural features
- **Image_Repository**: The local collection of 20-50 architectural photographs stored as JPEG files
- **Feature_Description**: Text-based description of visual architectural elements generated by the Vision_Model
- **Query_Processor**: The component that matches user queries against stored Feature_Descriptions
- **Web_Interface**: The user-facing application that accepts queries and displays results
- **Confidence_Score**: A numerical value indicating how well an image matches the user's query

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for buildings using natural language descriptions, so that I can find architectural images that match specific visual characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a natural language query, THE AI_Search_System SHALL process the query and return matching images within 5 seconds
2. THE AI_Search_System SHALL support queries about building materials such as "red brick", "stone facades", and "steel and glass"
3. THE AI_Search_System SHALL support queries about architectural features such as "flat roofs", "large windows", and "columns"
4. THE AI_Search_System SHALL return the top 3-5 most relevant images for each query
5. THE AI_Search_System SHALL display a Confidence_Score for each returned image

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see relevant architectural images with their AI-generated descriptions, so that I can understand why each image was selected for my query.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search results are displayed, THE Web_Interface SHALL show images in a grid layout
2. THE Web_Interface SHALL display the AI-generated Feature_Description for each result image
3. THE Web_Interface SHALL show the Confidence_Score alongside each image
4. THE Web_Interface SHALL provide a clean, professional appearance suitable for client demonstrations
5. THE Web_Interface SHALL display results within the same page without requiring navigation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to analyze building images and generate searchable descriptions, so that users can find relevant images through natural language queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Vision_Model SHALL analyze each image in the Image_Repository and generate Feature_Descriptions
2. THE AI_Search_System SHALL store Feature_Descriptions in a structured format for efficient querying
3. THE Vision_Model SHALL identify architectural materials including brick, stone, steel, glass, and concrete
4. THE Vision_Model SHALL identify architectural features including roof types, window styles, and building shapes
5. THE Query_Processor SHALL match user queries against stored Feature_Descriptions using text similarity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to work with a curated dataset of architectural images, so that the demo can showcase diverse building types and styles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Image_Repository SHALL contain between 20 and 50 architectural photographs
2. THE Image_Repository SHALL include buildings with diverse materials including brick, stone, steel, glass, and concrete
3. THE Image_Repository SHALL include buildings with various roof types including flat, pitched, and curved roofs
4. THE Image_Repository SHALL include buildings representing different architectural styles
5. THE AI_Search_System SHALL store all images as JPEG files in a local directory structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a presenter, I want the system to demonstrate reliable functionality during client meetings, so that I can showcase the AI search capabilities effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AI_Search_System SHALL successfully process at least 10 predefined test queries with reasonable accuracy
2. THE AI_Search_System SHALL run locally on a laptop without requiring internet connectivity for core functionality
3. THE Web_Interface SHALL provide a text input interface similar to ChatGPT for entering queries
4. THE AI_Search_System SHALL complete the full search process within 5 seconds for any query
5. THE AI_Search_System SHALL maintain consistent performance across multiple consecutive queries
